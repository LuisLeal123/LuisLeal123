Much of my public repositories here are small projects I do when I have free time. Private repositories are for what I've worked on.  

ðŸ’» My current projects:   
ðŸ““ IOS Sudoku app - Inspired by Dr. Tapia and his belief in using math to reduce the odds of brain disorders from old age, I hope to create
an IOS app that prompts the user with a daily sudoku problem to solve. I ultimately plan to expand its usage to other self-care uses, specifically
those in which I believe first hand would be helpful to those around me.   

ðŸŽ¨ Creative Website - For my first in-depth website to be built, I plan to showcase my best friend's art. Jesse James, the artist for my hometown's
mural, has worked extensively over the years in paintings, drawings, chalk art, and now tattoos. I want to be able to showcase his work
over the years, and allow for website visitors to be able to request commissions for drawings. His mural can be seen here: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyg-AsFx4EI/?img_index=1
